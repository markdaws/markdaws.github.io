<p>Blogging platforms du jour come and go and if you have put a lot of time and effort in to writing content on a blog you don't want to see it disappear when a service is shut down or merged with another company.  </p>

<p>For me, I've had several blogs, back when I could call myself a C# expert, I wrote lots of detailed articles on the internals of C# on my Microsoft Live Spaces blog (anyone remember that platform), alas it has long been shuttered and all the content I produced, lost. This time I wanted to be the last time I setup a blog, along with several criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>It should be easy to completely control the look and feel of my blog</li>
<li>I can run the blog locally if needed</li>
<li>Minimal cost to host the blog</li>
<li>Fast and capable of handling traffic spikes (never know when HN comes calling :P)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="solutiongithubpagesghostbustercostd0">Solution - Github Pages + Ghost + Buster - Cost $0</h3>

<p>What I ended up with was using the following services:  </p>

<h4 id="ghost">Ghost</h4>

<p><a href='https://ghost.org/' >Ghost</a> is a fully featured blogging platform written on <a href='http://nodejs.org/' >node.js</a> It is easy to quickly create beautiful looking websites, I liked it because of how simple it was to get up and running, plus the source code is also available that allows easy modification if needed.  </p>

<p>By default, Ghost requires a server to host the service, but I didn't want to have the hassle of setting up my own server, or opening a hosting account with a company that hosts Ghost blogs, so instead I went to route of turning my Ghost installation into a static website, which I can easily host for free. </p>

<h4 id="busterghoststaticsitegenerator">Buster - Ghost -> static site generator</h4>

<p><a href='https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster' >Buster</a> can be pointed at any Ghost blog, either one hosted on an external website, or one running locally on your own computer and output a directory with the static content of the site, HTML, CSS, images, fonts etc.  </p>

<p>This is great and simplifies the hosting options.  Simply install Ghost locally, then run Buster on it to generate a static site, the final step is to then find somewhere to host your static site.  </p>

<h4 id="githubwebsitehosting">GitHub - website hosting</h4>

<p><a href='http://github.com/' >Github</a> is a service mainly for programmers that allows them to store and share code.  However one nice feature of GitHub is something called <a href='https://pages.github.com/' >GitHub Pages</a> that allows you to easily create static websites for your projects.  I used GitHub pages to host the static Ghost site we generated using Buster.</p>

<h3 id="settingupyourblog">Setting Up Your Blog</h3>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I'm assuming you are not afraid of the command line and some HTML/CSS tweaking, if you are this solution is not for you.</p>

<p>Below are the steps I followed to get this blog up and running, it was suprising painless:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a <a href='http://github.com/' >GitHub</a> account  </li>
<li>Install <a href='http://docs.ghost.org/installation/' >Ghost</a> locally on your computer  </li>
<li>Install <a href='http://www.metacotta.com/ghost-static-site-generation-with-buster/' >Buster</a>  </li>
<li>Setup <a href='https://pages.github.com/' >GitHub Pages</a> for the repository you are going to use to host the blog. <strong>BONUS</strong>: if you want to setup a custom domain, follow <a href='https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages' >these</a> instructions.  </li>
<li>Modify config.js in your Ghost source code folder to update the URLs used on your site.  </li>
<li>To create a new theme for your site, follow the instructions <a href='http://docs.ghost.org/themes/' >here</a></li>
</ol>

<p>By this point you should have a local installation of Ghost running, created a few test articles, converted it to a static site using Buster and finally pushed the static site code to your GitHub pages repository and be looking at your spanking new site on the Interwebs.</p>

<h3 id="backingup">Backing Up</h3>

<p>An important part of the process is backing up your customized blog and articles.  With Ghost, we want to make sure we backup:</p>

<ul>
<li>Articles via sqlite DB</li>
<li>Modified Theme</li>
<li>Config changes</li>
</ul>

<p>I simply uploaded my whole ghost directory (minus the node_modules folder) to GitHub, this is so I have a copy of my modified theme, the articles DB and the entire site source code if needed.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>I found Ghost to be amazingly simple to setup and customize and easy to convert into a static site for <strong>FREE</strong> hosting on GitHub. Also I now have complete peace of mind that I will never lose my blog content again.  Happy blogging.</p>]]></description><link>http://markdaws.net/blog/fast-free-blog-courtesy-of-ghost-github-and-buster/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">d8d0853a-3e9d-42e5-ab82-443365864292</guid><category><![CDATA[github]]></category><category><![CDATA[ghost]]></category><category><![CDATA[blogging]]></category><category><![CDATA[tutorial]]></category><category><![CDATA[nodejs]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Mark Dawson]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2014 22:21:14 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
