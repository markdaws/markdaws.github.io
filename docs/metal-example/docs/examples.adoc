= Examples

Now we have all the pieces of our 3D engine in place we can make some examples.

The basic flow will be:

1. Create the Renderer passing in an instance of MTKView
2. Create a Mesh that has all of the 3D vertex information
3. Create a Material to use to describe how the Mesh should look, solid color, textured etc.
4. Create a Node to hold the Mesh instance. Set the transform on the Node to move the Mesh in the world
5. Add the Node to the Scene
6. Profit!

The code to create the cube sample is pretty simple:

.Examples.swift
[source,swift]
----
func createSingleCube(renderer: Renderer) {

  guard let metalTexture = Texture.loadMetalTexture(device: renderer.device, named: "bricks") else {
    return
  }

  let samplerDescriptor = MTLSamplerDescriptor()
  samplerDescriptor.normalizedCoordinates = true
  samplerDescriptor.minFilter = .linear
  samplerDescriptor.magFilter = .linear
  samplerDescriptor.mipFilter = .linear
  guard let sampler = renderer.device.makeSamplerState(descriptor: samplerDescriptor) else {
    return
  }

  let texture = Texture(mtlTexture: metalTexture, samplerState: sampler)
  let material = Material.createBasic(renderer: renderer, texture: texture)

  // Define the 3D vertices and colors for the vertices
  let dimension: Float = 3.0
  guard let cubeMesh = Primitives.cuboid(
    renderer: renderer,
    width: dimension,
    height: dimension,
    length: dimension) else {
    print("Failed to create the cuboid mesh")
    return
  }
  cubeMesh.material = material

  let node = Node(mesh: cubeMesh)
  node.position.x = 10
  renderer.scene.root.addChild(node)
}

As you can see we create a cube mesh, calling a helper method in the Primitives class, the load our texture from the bundle.
Once we have the texture we can create a BasicMaterial that understands texture coordinates and apply it to the mesh.
The final piece is to create a node and add it to the scene hierarchy.
